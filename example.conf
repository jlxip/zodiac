; ✨ Welcome to the zodiac example configuration file ✨

; This includes all possible options along with an explanation to each one
; I would suggest reading this file, and then writing your own from
; scratch, in order to make it shorter.

; This is a INI file. It's made up of sections, keys, and values.
; [section]
; key = value ; Comment

; The [zodiac] section is the root of the configuration file
[zodiac]
; Listen on all interfaces. This is the default value.
listenIP = 0.0.0.0
; This is the default as well. You cannot run zodiac on more than one
; port at the same time, but you can run two instances of the program
; without issues.
listenPort = 1965

; Now, for some timeouts
; - They are specified in seconds
; - They refer to the whole duration of the process, not only idle time
; - They cannot be disabled due to security reasons
; - Some values can be overriden in capsule sections, as you'll see below
; - Default is 5 seconds for all of them

; Seconds until connections to zodiac time out (request reception)
frontTimeout = 3
; Seconds until connections to backends time out. This field is used both
; for the backend connection establishment and the response reception.
; So, bear in mind that a connection to the backend could take at max
; 2x the value specified.
backTimeout = 10
; Seconds until TLS handshake times out
hsTimeout = 5

; The "workers" field specifies the number of worker threads to run
; - Deafult value is 0, which means "as many as threads in the CPU"
; - Do not use more than the number of cores: it will throttle. They are
;   not directly related to how many simultaneous connections zodiac
;   can handle.
workers = 5

; The "buffers" field specifies how many pages should be allocated
; - This does actually put a limit to the number of simultaneous
;   connections. If no buffers are available, new connections will be
;   kept open waiting until there's one
; - In most architectures, regular pages are 4KiB long
; - The default value is 256 (so 1MiB total)
buffers = 512

; The "enabled" field is the most important one. Its contents link
; to other sections of this file, each describing a capsule.
enabled = mycapsule, other



; The following is a backend section overriding all default values
[mycapsule]
; "name" specifies the Common Name (CN) for this capsule. That is,
; the server name that will be specified in the "Client Hello" message
; from the TLS handshake. It's a critical field, since zodiac performs
; request demultiplexing based on SNI (Server Name Identification).
; In other words, if a Gemini client asks for "gemini://jlxip.net",
; this website will be offered. This field is required.
name = jlxip.net

; If a request is made with an invalid SNI, like "gemini://foo.bar",
; a capsule can still be served. The "default" field specifies to
; serve this capsule, with its TLS certificate. Do note that
; the client will probably give a security error since SNI does not
; match the hostname. The same behavior is applied in case the
; request comes from a Gemini browser that does not support SNI.

; If none of the capsules are the default, one will be chosen
; at random for its TLS certificate. Then, after the handshake,
; zodiac will return status code 41 ("NOT FOUND").

; The "default" values exempts the need to have a "name" field,
; in case you want to have an actual different default capsule.
; Still, you can have both to use a capsule as a regular server and
; the default one.
default = true

; A TLS certificate is required for all Gemini servers. The "cert" and
; "key" fields point to files in PEM format. If you're not familiar
; with this terminology, it's fine: most browsers accept self-signed
; certificates. You can generate one like this:
;   openssl req -newkey ed25519 -nodes \
;     -keyout /tmp/key.pem \
;     -x509 -days 365 \
;     -out /tmp/cert.pem
cert = /tmp/cert.pem ; Default is "./cert.pem"
key = /tmp/key.pem ; Default is "./key.pem"

; The "backend" field specifies the FastCGI-like backend server IP
; to connect to. It can also be a hostname; in that case, it will
; be resolved only once before accepting any requests.
; Default value is "localhost".
backend = 172.17.0.2

; Linked to the previous field, this is the port to connect to.
; A value for it is required.
port = 7000

; As said before, some timeout values can be overriden
frontTimeout = 1
backTimeout = 1
; You, however, cannot override "hsTimeout", since, before the
; TLS handshake is finished, zodiac cannot know the server capsule
; you're trying to reach.



; The following is a more realistic capsule, using all the defaults
[other]
name = other.arpa
port = 7001
